Queen Venus & The Black Dahlia

These girls are my sidekicks at the shop.  They've been there from the very beginning of my journey as an entrepreneur on a mission.  

These two, along with the other furry loves in my life have taught me patience, consistency, the art of reading body language, compassion, mindfulness, playfulness, and resiliency.

Twelve years ago, when I first ventured down "the rabbit" hole that opened my eyes to the scary things going on behind closed doors and the magic curtain of multi-million dollar marketing campaigns, I was sick to my stomach and I was effected in the deepest parts of my being.  That day was the beginning of my journey.

Since then, these girls have seen me through it all.  They symbolize the fight; the mission to change the world, to obliterate the demand for the products we ignorantly and blissfully consume that are perpetuating cruel practices and destroying our resources.

They stand for my left and right hook in this fight.  And we will win.
