**33 Days into 2016**

I woke up this morning on the couch at 7:20\.  Alarmed, thinking I had a virtual meeting at 7:30, I quickly put on the Keurig, ran up stairs to wash the sleep out of my eyes, and then rushed back down to realize my meeting is for tomorrow morning.

With the new realization that I have a somewhat clean slate on my schedule for the next hour, I thought I'd check and see if my GRID account was ready to activate yet.  It has been over a year since I signed on to be a founding member and they started launching betas in October.  I am founding member \#16332, and last I checked they had been launching an average of 10,000 member sites per month.  

I logged onto my secondary email, the one I use for not so urgent stuff, and began sifting through.  Lo' and behold, about 10 unread emails in, I see "Grid Beta Activation Notice".  

Today is a great day!!

Cheers to post numero uno on my very own Ai website, on the 33rd day of 2016\.
